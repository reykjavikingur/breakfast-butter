# Butter

Butter, a tool for building atomic UI toolkits.

## Quick Start

Globally install the Butter CLI:
```sh
$ npm install -g brkfst-butter-cli
```

Change directory to the folder where you want to install Butter:
```sh
$ cd /Development/Butter
```

Run the Butter-CLI `install` command:
```sh
$ butter install
```
> You will be prompted for an optional username and password which can be used to secure Butter with [Basic Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication). If you do not wish to secure your butter URL simply press enter/return and skip the prompts. 

Launch Butter:
```sh
$ npm test
```

Butter should now be running in your browser and watching for changes to your toolkit files. The default url is: 
`http://localhost:3000`
